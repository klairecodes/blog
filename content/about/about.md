Hi I'm Klaire! I use she/they pronouns, and I study Computer Science at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). At RIT, I am one of the System Administrators for the organization (Computer Science House)[https://csh.rit.edu]. People keep giving me root access to all of their systems for some reason, and I find this is ill-advised.
