## Components

- Coffee: 11g
    - Grind: finer than pour over, almost espresso
        - Go lighter for darker roasts
- Water: 200g @ 100℃
    - Light Roast: (50g coffee:1L water @ 100℃)
    - Dark Roast: (60g coffee:1L water @ 85℃)
- Aeropress, kettle


## Method

1. Start boiling water.
2. Set up Aeropress like normal on a scale.
3. Add coffee grounds, then water as quickly as possible.
4. PUT PLUNGER IN TOP at a 45° angle, then straighten and pull upwards slightly (this stops the draining)
5. Wait 2 minutes.
6. Gently swirl the entire assembly.
7. Wait 30 seconds.
8. Start to press, evenly, without putting on too much weight. Should be comfortable while standing upright. Should take 30 seconds.
9. Slightly pull up the plunger.
10. Discard grounds by pressing the plunger towards your trash bin.
