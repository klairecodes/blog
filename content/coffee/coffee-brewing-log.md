## **General Coffee Notes**



* Equipment weights (note: shitty scale):
    * Kettle: 682.0g
    * Aeropress: 183.0g
        * Filter holder: 15.0g
        * Base: 84.5
        * Plunger: 84.0
    * Grinder: 540.5g
        * Grounds holder: 105.5g
        * Bean Assembly: 330.5g
        * Arm: 105.0g
    * Melitta Dripper: 57.0g
    * Hario Decanter: 387.0g
    * Eric Cup: 235.0g
    * 
* General starting ratios:
    * Infusion: 75g/L
    * Percolation: 60g/L
* Use a coarser grind for a Melitta than for a V60.
* V60 plastic more worth it than ceramic because preheating it is annoying.
* Experiment: V60 method with Melitta vs blooming and just pouring all the water all at once
    * Results: V60 had a lot more body and flavor, worth the extra effort
    * Very similar once cooled
* V60 handles finer grinds MUCH better, way more body and flavor coming through

#### Melitta Pour Over



* 1.6 - too watery, no body
* 1.6 - wtf why was it better this time
* 1.62 - didn't bloom long enough, smoother but quite sour
* 1.7 - almost there, but a constant sour undertone
* 1.1 @80C - PERFECTâ„¢, bitterness coming through but not to strong, no sour, got more bitter as it cooled
* 1.61 @80C into Hario Decanter - more bitter, smooth


#### Aeropress



* 1.1 - bitter undertone throughout
* 1.8 - sour, earthy
* 1.7 - low body, slightly sour, more sour as it cooled, close!!
* 1.61 - better than 1.7 but still difficult to tell apart, nice bitterâ„¢ coming through, less sour, again more sour as it cooled 
* 1.61 @ 90Â°C - 30 seconds late to swirling, smoother!!, much less sour, under extracted, bitter as it cooled 
* 1.61 @ 90Â°C x 15.5g - strong (duh) bitter even when immediately drank hot, VERY sour when cooled off
* 1.4 @ 85Â°C x 15.5g - strong, bitter initially




### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Small Planes Coffee: Las CabaÃ±as</span>


#### V60



* 1.52 - cleaner cup than Melitta, very little bitter, no sour, extremely pleasant could probably try finer for more body
* 1.41 - more sour immediately, stronger, definitely more extraction, very sour throughout cooling
* TRY LOWER TEMP ^^
* 1.5 @ 80Â°C - smooth, weak body
* 1.41* @ 80Â°C - smooth, stronger body but could be better
* 1.41* @ 80Â°C x 18g - smooth, much stronger but still a light mouth feel, close, more actual bitter (not sour) that I like
* 1.32 @ 80Â°C - PERFECT, strong and smooth throughout, no notes of sour, the slightest hint of bitter that I'm interpreting as body
* 1.31 @ 80Â°C w Decanter - hardly a difference from ^, lost a lot more heat causing differences, immediately pleasant to drink, very good extraction, bitter ending notes when cold, no sour
* 1.2 @ 80Â°C - PERFECT way more body, stronger, way more flavor coming through, also more earth though, RAISIN CAME THROUGH
* 1.2 (normal 100Â°C, thoroughly warmed dripper, filter , and cup) - smoother experience than ^^ but I could be imagining it 
* 1.2 w Decanter double batch - notes of bitter but otherwise extremely smooth and pleasant
* 1.2 + caffeine pill - placed a caffeine pill at the bottom of the filter then grounds on top, pill hardly dissolved, no perceptible difference in taste without reference
* 1.2 w Melitta 02 filter - not as clean of a cup, bitter at the start
* 1.2 w Decanter double batch - sour undertone for some reason this time, maybe misstasted the last time? still smooth and pleasant just sour as it cooled, drank quickly
