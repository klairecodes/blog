## General Coffee Notes
- General starting ratios:
    - Infusion: 75g/L
    - Percolation: 60g/L
- Use a coarser grind for a Melitta than for a V60.
- V60 plastic more worth it than ceramic because preheating it is annoying.
- Experiment: V60 method with Melitta vs blooming and just pouring all the water all at once
    - Results: V60 had a lot more body and flavor, worth the extra effort
    - Very similar once cooled
- V60 handles finer grinds MUCH better, way more body and flavor coming through
