Welome to my blog!  
Here is where I'm going to test some syntax highlighting:

```python
main():
    exitText = "done"
    for i in range(2:.3):
        print(f"Called {i} times.)
    print(exitText)
main()
```

Anyway I'm at a cabin on Brandreth lake in the Adirondacks creating this site. Thank you Willard for showing me such a cool static site generator! Also I love [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/) :heart:.
